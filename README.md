Book8088 + Waveshare Zero Playground

Learning RP2040

Planned features so far, in addition to already present external keyboard functionality from my BookKbd project:
* control Book8088 leds - via setting alarm delay
* control Turbo and Mute - via GPIO
* play floppy sounds on USB activity - https://github.com/rgrosset/pico-pwm-audio
